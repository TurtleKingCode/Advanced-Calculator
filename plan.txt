Math would always go though an examination process wheter we use Basic or Quadralateral
Basic - Solves the simplest of math
Trig:
cos/sin/tan
acos/asin/atan
cosh/sinh/tanh
acosh/asinh/atanh
[a, c, h, i, n, o, s, t]


Basic-Algebra - 
Quadralateral
Polynomial
General - Solves all math, but little focus on other things


1. Get Math
2. Examine Math
3. Determine Action
4. Chop Math
5. Configure Math
6. Solve Math
7. Reveal Math
8. Repeat Process
----------------------------------
Basic:
+-*/()


Scientific:
sin, cos, tan, pi, e, log, sqrt, cbrt, 3 root(3)
^!%




Things you must remember to do in the very end:

- There is a number list that you acutally don't need
- 



1. Notice that it exists
2. Find it's location, and log it.
3. Move to the left and log what is there
4. If Number
	a. Replace that location with "factorial(Number)"
5. Else if ')'
	a. Make an Array
	b. Set up a variable to keep track of things
	c. Put that into the Array
	d. Move to the left
	e. Check what it is
	f. If it is ')'
		a. Increment the value
	g. If it is '('
		a. Decrement the value
	h. Else
		a. Continue with ste c, d, e down
	i. continue until variable is empty
	j. Once empty, move to the left and check what that is
	k. If it is a function
		a. Add it to the Array
	l. If it is not a function
		a. Do nothing important
	m. Go now to that index location
	n. Remove everything worth the length of your Array plus one
	o. Replace it with everything in that Array
6. Now with that done... Chop that array
7. Repeat everything until there are none left
