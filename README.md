# How to Use my Calculator
My Advance Calculater has 4 differe Calculators in it and I know this is rushed, but this is where you understand how to use it
## Tags
My Advance Calculator has 4 Different types of Calculators inside of it...
1. Basic
2. Scientific
3. Linear
4. Quadratic<br/>
In order to be able to use each of them, you need to know their tags...<br/>
The tag is the string you put infront of your math to tell Felix what Calculator to use<br/>
If you have ever used Discord Bots, you sort of understand where I'm coming from.<br/>
Now... Here are the Tags:
1. Basic: `basic`<br/>
	a. `Example: basic (8 - 4) * 10`<br/>
	b. `Example: basic 3 + 3 * 10`
2. Scientific: `sci`<br/>
	a. `Example: sci cos(pi) + sin(tau)`<br/>
	b. `Example: sci (8 + 4)/10`<br/>
	c. `Example: sci root(4, 256) --> This means the Fourth Root of 256
3. Linear: `linear`<br/>
	a. `Example: linear 3x + 2y = 10`<br/>
	b. `Example: linear y = 10x - 30`<br/>
	c. `Example: linear 0.5y - 10x`
4. Quadratic: `quad`<br/>
	a. `Example: quad 3x^2 + 10x - 15 = 0`<br/>
	b. `Example: quad 3(x - 19)^2 - 10`<br/>

Now, the Scientific Calculater is the default setting so if you want to use that one, you actually don't need a tag infront of it... But for the rest, you do.<br/><br/>
However, If you want to change the default calculator... What you do is use the tag `default` and then type the tag of the calculator you want to switch default to.<br/>
`Example: default quad`<br/>
`Example: default linear`<br/>
`Example: default basic`<br/>

Keep in mind that you have to be very careful how you input your Tags and your Math so that Felix can read it.  Felix already has a lot in his hads reading your math and helping you with your Math homework.  The least you could do is be considerate and make it easier on him to read.<br/>
## Scientific Calculator
My Scientific Calculator is my most Advanced and Complex of all the Calculators I built here.<br/>
While all of the others took no more than a day and a half to build... This one took a whole 7 days... And as such deserves a deeper description thatn the others...<br/><br/>
### Trig Functions
My Scientific Calculator has 12 Trigonometric Functions.  Those include:
1. The Three main `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
2. Their inverses `asin`, `acos`, `atan`
3. The Hyperbolics `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`
4. And Their inverses `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`
### Using Trig Functions
The syntax for these trig functions is as such:</br>
Example: `cos(pi)`</br>
Example: `sin(tau)`</br>
Example: `tan(10 + 10 - 20)`</br>
### Degrees or Radians
My Scientific Calculator accepts Degrees and Radians... But you have to set it up youself.</br>
The Default Angle Setting is Radians.  You can change that using the `angle` tag and following up with the name of the angle setting.</br>
This is very very similar to the how you use the `default` tag.</br>
Example: `angle degrees`</br>
Example: `angle radians`</br>
### Constants
I have a few Constants in use in my Scientific Calculator... Those include
`pi`, `e`, `tau`</br>
As for how to use them... It's super easy...</br>
Example: `pi + tau - e^2 - cos(pi)`
### Operators
My Calculator accepts 8 operators... Those being `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.</br>
It also Accepts factorial `!`, percentage `%`, and exponents in two forms `^` and `**` (for those of us programmers).</br>
Now, for the Sake of You programmers out there... I know y'all are sad to see me use the `%` for percentage... Don't worry, You can still acces modules.  All you've got to do is use `mod`.</br>
Example: `3 mod 2` --> NO PARENTHESES.  `mod` is an operator not a function.
